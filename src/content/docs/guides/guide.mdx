description: A reference page in my new Starlight docs site.

Reference pages are ideal for outlining how things work in terse and clear terms.
Less concerned with telling a story or addressing a specific use case, they should give a comprehensive outline of what you're documenting.

## Multi-language code blocks

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="JS" icon="">
  ```js
  function demo() {
    return 'This is line #2 of this snippet';
  }
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Python" icon="">
    ```python
    def demo() :
      return 'This is line #2 of this snippet'
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
